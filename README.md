Analysis

The analysis uses Python and various data analysis libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Jupyter Notebooks are used to document and present the analysis process step-by-step. And we have used Power BI for data visualization

The analysis includes the following key aspects:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the structure of the data, checking for missing values, and performing data cleaning and preprocessing.
Restaurant Performance: Analyzing restaurant ratings, customer reviews, and order volumes to identify top-performing restaurants.
Menu Analysis: Examining popular dishes, cuisine preferences, and average order values to understand customer preferences.
Order Trends: Studying the time-based patterns of orders to optimize delivery logistics and staffing.
